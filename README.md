# Energy Demand

This project was conducted during the course "Business Analytics and Data Science Applications". 
Our goal is to provide energy traders with information, so they can make informed decisions and match supply and demand in the energy market. 

Our approach uses historic weather and energy demand data from the UK, ranging from 2018 to 2023.
